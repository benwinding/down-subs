Download Segments From YouTube Based on Subtitles

This was a fun little project to download YouTube videos based on a text search of the subtitles of a video or playlist.

# Example
1. Download all subtitle files from playlist
2. Search all files for phrase "Well Jay", return timestamps
3. Download all timestamps for all instances of phrase
